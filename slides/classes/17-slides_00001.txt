HW 6
Final Project
Split into 3 groups of 4 and picked an SC '25 pair:

Pair Benchmark Application

1 MLPerf Exascale Climate Emulator
2 HPL-MxP — Structural Simulation Toolkit
3 HPL Reproducibility Challenge

Get running, tune, and design report on results.

Present work on last day of class 12/10 - 15-20 minutes per group
Final report due last day of finals 12/19

HW 6

. Submit a short reflection on setting up the shared infrastructure using Ansible etc.
. Complete the linked Mid Semester Assessment Google Form. (not posted yet)
. Submit a research report on SLURM v Kubernetes v other schedulers.

. Attempt one of the Ansible tutorials on the CS 352 Wiki and submit your notes.
HW 6.5

1. Implement a naive library routine and measure it’s performance relative to an
optimized library implementation.

2. Read the posted paper on algorithmic optimizations in HPC and submit your notes.

3. Submit a Budget Proposal for $850 to improve the cluster (optional but required in
HW 07}
