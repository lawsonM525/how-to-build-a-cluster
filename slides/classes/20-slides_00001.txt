Final Project
Split into 3 groups of 4 and picked an SC '25 pair:

Pair Benchmark Application

1 MLPerf Exascale Climate Emulator
2 HPL-MxP — Structural Simulation Toolkit
3 HPL Reproducibility Challenge

Get running, tune, and design report on results.

Present work on last day of class 12/10 - 15-20 minutes per group
Final report due last day of finals 12/19

Groups

1. Ronin, Glenvelis, Sarah, Bintu
2. Sydney, Molly, Maggie, Ashley
3. Mary, Ashby, Tajhini, Michelle
Final Proj. Timeline/Check in

1. Initial numbers

> (11/14) Benchmark running
> (11/21) App running

2. (12/5) Optimize cluster
» compilers, flags, build process, software, hardware, libraries, etc
3. (12/10) Present current results
4. (12/11-12/18) Write final repot draft
5. (12/19) Turn in final report
HW 6

1. Submit a short reflection on setting up the shared infrastructure using Ansible etc.
2. Submit a research report on SLURM v Kubernetes v other schedulers.

3. Attempt one of the Ansible tutorials on the CS 352 Wiki and submit your notes.
HW 6.5

0. Complete the linked Mid Semester Assessment Google Form.

1. Implement a naive library routine and measure it’s performance relative to an
optimized library implementation.

2. Read the posted paper on algorithmic optimizations in HPC and submit your notes.

3. Submit a Budget Proposal for $850 to improve the cluster (optional but required in
HW 07}
HW 7

Due Date: 11/21?

0.
1.

Read GPU Paper and submit a short reflection and/or notes

Complete in-class vectorization example with demonstrated speedups, include your
code, vectorization report, and a graph or table of performance

Discussion reflection from Kubernetes/SLURM/Flux debate and vote

Submit a Budget Proposal for $850 to improve the cluster (optional but required in
HW 07}

Debian vote of no/confidence?

install GPUs?

>» SLURM:
> Controller + compute nodes; configure slurm.conf (NodeName, PartitionName).
>» Enable cgroups and backfill; set accounting if you want fair-share.
> MPI:
> Install OpenMPI or MPICH on all nodes; test with hello_mpi and srun.
> Networking:
> Ensure consistent hostnames, time sync (chrony), passwordless SSH for admin, shared
home or NFS for job I/O (careful with NFS hotspots).
> Containers:
>» Apptainer integrates well with SLURM for HPC workflows; no root daemon required.
