LLM Synthesis Prompts

Synthesize the following student responses to create a singular “Mission Statement” for
the parallel computing cluster we are building for our course:

Please elucidate the primary themes in the combined mission statement into a bulleted
outline.

Make this more concise.
GPT-40

The mission of our parallel computing cluster is to provide Smith students with a
high-performance computational tool that empowers innovation, collaboration, and
exploration. Through the process of building this system, students will gain hands-on
experience in designing and operating a cluster that is both functional and efficient —
capable of addressing problems too large or complex for single machines to solve. This
project, inspired by benchmarks from the Student Cluster Competition (SCC) and
guided by principles of energy-conscious computing, will balance performance,
sustainability, and accessibility.

Our goals include fostering creativity, technical expertise, and teamwork as we build a
resource that will support a range of academic pursuits, from running Al and machine
learning models to conducting scientific simulations and exploring reproducible
environments for experimentation. The cluster will be designed to enable a wide variety
of applications, such as data analysis, neural network training, and even interactive,
simulated worlds where complex systems can be analyzed.
GPT-4o (cont.)

This mission is guided by a commitment to inclusivity, open science, and ethical
technology. We aim to create an accessible and robust system that will serve students
and faculty beyond our class, offering tools for research, education, and personal
exploration. By engaging in this project, we hope to inspire the next generation of
computer scientists and cultivate an environment of respect, curiosity, and fun.

Ultimately, this project will not only produce a valuable computing resource for the
Smith community but will also serve as a model of how collaborative innovation can
solve real-world problems responsibly and creatively.
Outline of Primary Themes
1. Purpose and Goals

> Build a high-performance parallel computing cluster to solve complex problems

beyond single machines.
> Enable a variety of applications (e.g., AI/ML, simulations, data analysis, and more).
>» Balance performance with energy efficiency and sustainability.

2. Educational Focus

> Provide hands-on learning in cluster design, operating systems, networking, and
parallel programming.

> Foster teamwork, collaboration, and creative problem-solving.

> Engage with industry benchmarks (e.g., Student Cluster Competition) to inspire
and evaluate progress.

3. Post-Build Objectives

» Serve as a reliable resource for Smith students and faculty for research and learning.
» Prioritize accessibility and reproducibility to support open science.
