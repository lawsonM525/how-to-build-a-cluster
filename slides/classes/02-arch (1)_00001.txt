Clock Speeds and a Virtuous Cycle

Clock speed (or cycle) is selected so that the parts of the CPU can
finish basic calculations within the cycle

Commonly measured in GHz (billions of times per second)
Making transistors smaller

P they go faster (quicker to turn on/off)
> fit more per unit area
Moore’s Law

The complexity for minimum component costs has increased
at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the
short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase.
Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain,
although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly
constant for at least 10 years. - Gordon Moore

Commonly, “computer performance doubles every 18-24 months”

More precisely, the number of transistors per unit area (per dollar)
doubles every two years

Measuring/Evaluating Hardware: FLOPS

Floating Point Oerations Per second

Common Examples

>» GPU

>» Watch?

Somewhat fuzzy with “Al” FLOPs now

Raw measure of CPU performance (does not measure
memory(RAM/IO) bandwidth or other factors)
Calculate FLOPs: Example

Kaby Lake
Clock Freq: 2.8 GHz

Cores: 2

FLOPs/Cycle: 16
Memory: Key Terms

Latency - time to fetch 1 byte

Bandwidth - throughput e.g. bytes/s

Lab Activity 1: Open Up and ID

Part 1:

- Go over to lab

- Take a piece of scratch paper

- Grab a cluster node

- Open up and document graphically/with pictures the parts

Part 2:

- Put the cover back up

- Find a monitor (or share)

- Boot up and confirm/cross check!
- Turn in results

HW 2 Preview/For Next Time

1. Estimate/calculate theoretical peak FLOPs of:

» Your computer
» Single node in cluster
>» Our entire system

2. Measure (via Linpack) the actual peak
3. Fill in table of memory latencty/bandwidth
4. Read

>» Gordon Moore’s original article (Moodle)
> OS/Linux Server Distros

5. Prep for “distro debate” (teams forthcoming)
6. Synthesize mission statements
